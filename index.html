          This visualisation was created from a #MakeoverMonday dataset. The original visualisation can be found <a href="https://howmuch.net/articles/world-map-of-drug-exports-2016">here</a>.
          <br><br>At first I envisaged a network diagram showing flows of exports from one country to another. My second idea was a slope chart comparing exporters with consumers.
          Both plans changed when I realised the dataset didn't contain the level of detail required.
          <br><br>Returning to the original visualisation, I realised that the aim was to give a sense of scale to the exports by country. As a parts to whole relationship, this inspired me to try a tree-map. After a little data prep (the data included categories for ship stores and bunkers!) I mocked it up in Tableau. Immediately I was struck with the idea that the squares looked like tablets.
          <br><br>By now I'd missed the Makeover Monday deadline - but I couldn't get the idea out of my head.
          I took a screenshot of the Tableau treemap and opened in Photoshop Elements, where I used it as a template to draw tablet shapes, using drop shadows and bevel styles to create the 3D effect.
          <br><br>I changed the colour scheme to colours that reminded me of medicine, ensuring that all countries within a region were similar in colour. 
          The predominance of European countries really stood out, providing the key insight which I emphasised with a colour-matched sub-heading.
